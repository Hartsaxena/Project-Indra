# Project-Indra
This is a small Python project I wanted to create as a hobby.

In order to download it, follow the DownloadGuide.txt file's instructions
I'm definitely a beginner at Python, so I'm sorry if any (or all) of my code is inefficient.

If you have any advice or suggestions for me, just comment it!
