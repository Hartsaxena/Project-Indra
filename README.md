# Project-Indra
This is a small Python project I wanted to create as a hobby.

In order to download it, follow the DownloadGuide.txt file's instructions, or run the Downloader.py file (There is a Work-In-Progress app version of the program, but that hasn't been tested thoroughly yet).
I'm definitely a beginner at Python, so I'm sorry if any (or all) of my code is inefficient. I'm learning new things Everday!
